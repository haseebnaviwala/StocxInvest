The assets of a business are the capital stock that make it possible -- with the addition of labor -- for the company to generate a profit. Assets may include factories, land, inventories, vehicles and other items. But not all assets are created equal. Some assets, such as cash, are easy to value and liquidate. Others, such as buildings and farmland, are quite real too, if somewhat more difficult to value accurately. These kinds of assets are collectively known as tangible assets. Intangible assets, such as goodwill, also can be important to the success of the enterprise. Goodwill, for instance, could include a valued brand name gained in an acquisition (a famous brand, such as Coca-Cola, doesn't normally show up on a balance sheet otherwise). In general, firms are required to carry assets on their books at cost less depreciation. This conservative principle means that the balance sheets of most companies understate the true value of their holdings. Land purchased 50 years ago and carried at cost might be worth many times the initial price, for instance. Conversely, a firm that owns a brand new buggy-whip factory might in fact overstate the value of its assets by carrying them at cost.

Investors look to cash flow for several reasons: because firms have accounting leeway when it comes to reporting net income; because depreciation charges, while substantial in many industries, aren't genuine bills that have to be paid; and because cash flow is the key to a company's ability to pay dividends, cover debts and so forth. Thus, some analysts focus on the ratio of price to cash flow rather than the traditional price/earnings (P/E) measure. Cash flow is especially useful in assessing firms in capital intensive industries -- cable TV, for instance -- in which huge depreciation charges can hide healthy profits.",

Basically, what the income statement shows is revenue and expenses, including operating expenses, depreciation, income taxes and extraordinary items. Using the income statement, an investor can quickly figure cash flow, profit margins and other important indicators of how the business is doing. That said, it's important to remember that accounting is as much an art as a science, and the income statement is often the result of some important judgment calls by both management and the company's auditors. These judgments can substantially affect a firm's showing in a given period. Thus, it's important to read the footnotes, since these often disclose the kinds of judgments that were made, as well as other material information.",

The advantage of income stocks, in addition to their stability, is that even if the stock isn't doing much, you're getting that nice regular dividend. Yet unlike a bond, the stock still gives you some potential for capital appreciation as well. The down side is that such stocks can be sensitive to rising interest rates, which make the dividend look less attractive versus riskless Treasury securities and certificates of deposit. Such stocks can also be sensitive to inflation, which erodes the buying power of the dividend. Also, industries that once looked very stable have become less so in a deregulated and increasingly global economy.",

In fact, indexing has become extremely popular in recent years as investors have noticed how frequently the S&P 500 has trounced actively managed funds. One reason is that index funds have very low expenses, since there are no high-priced analysts or stock-pickers needed. Another reason is that index funds do very little trading, which saves commissions. There are now index funds for small-cap stocks, international stocks, corporate bonds and other categories of investing, all offering simply to match the market.

When a downturn is anticipated, many investors shun the bonds of companies that might not be able to pay interest or principal if business should turn sour.
